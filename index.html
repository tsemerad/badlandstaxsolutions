							<h2>Controlling your journey, Part II</h2>
							<p>Aren't holiday weekends great? You have an extra day to sleep in or get caught up on errands, home projects, etc.
								Holiday weekends always give us a glimpse of what retirement will feel like. It will be our reward for all of those
								years of hard work! If you're a baby boomer you're probably thinking about retirement more than ever. As you approach
								the final chapters of your working years, you'll be faced with <b>two incredibly significant decisions.</b> When
								should I retire? When should I start taking Social Security?</p>
							<p>In terms of Social Security, maybe you didn't think much of it and just figured you'd start drawing at age 62. The
								decision when to take it is not one-size-fits-all.
								<b>Many factors need to be considered.</b> Some of the Social Security rules have changed. Do you know what they
								are? More importantly, do you know if they affect you? Plus, you may have already heard from friends and family that
								the Social Security office can't even advise you on your choices! The timing of your Social Security retirement benefit
								is a major decision that will impact your retirement years. Competent retirement planning is an important part of
								controlling your journey.</p>
							<p>Here at Badlands Tax Solutions, Inc., we have the tools necessary to run different Social Security scenarios that
								are based upon your own personal situation. This educational approach will help to inform your decision on taking
								Social Security. Folks, this will be your last hurrah!
								<b>You never plan to fail, but for this matter, you can't fail to plan.</b> Armed with this information, you will
								have a clear view of when you will start drawing Social Security. More importantly, you will know <em>why</em> based
								upon your circumstances. Looking back over the years, we often face regrets that are connected to what we should,
								would, or could have done in life. For your Social Security retirement benefit, plan and prepare so that some day
								you can say, "I'm so grateful I made the time to do it right for me." Call, email, Facebook message, Tweet, fax or
								visit Badlands Tax Solutions, Inc. today to schedule your Social Security review. Control your journey!</p>
